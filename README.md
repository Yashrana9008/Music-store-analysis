ðŸš€ **New Project Alert: Music Store Analysis with MySQL! ðŸŽ¶** ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I utilized MySQL to analyze a music store's data. This project involves several insightful analyses, including:

1. Identifying the senior-most employee by job title.
2. Determining the countries with the most invoices.
3. Finding the top values of total invoices.
4. Pinpointing the city with the highest total invoice sum for a promotional event.
5. Highlighting the best customer based on total spending.
6. Listing all Rock Music listeners and inviting top rock artists.
7. Returning tracks longer than the average song length.
8. Calculating customer spending on artists.
9. Discovering the most popular music genre by country.
10. Identifying the top-spending customer in each country.

This project showcases my ability to handle complex queries and derive valuable insights from data. Check out the full analysis in my project presentation!
